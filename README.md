### COMP0034 Web Development
This repository is a very simple illustration of use of the the Flask-Uploads package with Flask-WTF and Flask-SQLAlchemy.

Note: There appears to be a compatibility issue with the recent release of Werkzeug 1.0.0 and Flask-Uploads. You may need to use Werkzeug 0.16.1 to get the uploads to work.
